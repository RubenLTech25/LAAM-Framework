A computational implementation of the **Lopez Theory of Asymmetric Enforcement (LTAE)**, as presented in the paper ["The Lopez Theory of Asymmetric Enforcement: Designing Fairness Across AI and Human Systems"](https://your-academia-link-here.com).

LAAM is a game-theoretic framework designed to diagnose and correct structural power imbalances in regulatory audits (e.g., tax, healthcare, labor) by introducing strategic memory, dynamic fairness, and transparent AI into enforcement systems.

## ðŸ§  Framework Overview

LAAM rebalances asymmetric enforcement through three core mechanisms:

1.  **Strategic Memory (`Audit Anchors`)**: Documents past infractions but weights them with an exponential decay function (`A(t) = A0 * e^(-Î»t)`), ensuring mistakes are not held against entities in perpetuity.
2.  **Dynamic Fairness (`Forgiveness Thresholds`)**: Algorithmically resets an entityâ€™s risk profile after `n` consecutive clean audits, creating a credible path to redemption.
3.  **Transparent AI (`Bias-Aware Bayesian Updates`)**: Classifies entities (Compliant, Risky, Evasive) based on behavior and evidence, not static labels. All auditor discretion is logged and auditable.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/LAAM-Framework.git
    cd LAAM-Framework
    ```

2.  (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The core functionality can be imported and used directly:

```python
from laam.core import BayesianAuditor, calculate_anchor_decay

# Initialize an auditor for the 'tax' sector
auditor = BayesianAuditor(sector='tax')

# Update beliefs based on a signal (e.g., 'missing_doc')
auditor.update_beliefs('missing_doc')
print(auditor.beliefs) # Output: {'C': 0.15, 'R': 0.45, 'E': 0.40}

# Calculate decay of an audit anchor
initial_weight = 1.0
decayed_weight = calculate_anchor_decay(initial_weight, decay_rate=0.3, time_elapsed=2)
print(f"Decayed anchor weight: {decayed_weight:.4f}") # Output: ~0.5488

Usage & Simulations
See the simulations/basic_demo.py script for a complete example simulating an OSHA inspection scenario across multiple audit cycles, demonstrating anchor creation, decay, and belief updating.
